34.,"I ordered a size:M , and this is very well made I am 5'4"" and122 pounds, it fits perfect . The stitching is well done, the zipper is easy to zip, actually words cannot say how a lighter weight but not thin at all can look this nice, the fit is definitely not tight(not) oh I ordered this in black, can put full hands in the pockets, the gap logo on the inside is stitched all around no loose ends, it is quite pretty, well worth the money, I didn't have a problem at all with any shrinkage, washed in machine and fully dried it, order one, I am not getting any bonus for this review so, it fits like a hoodie should fit, not as I said tight at all!!","Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Gap-womens-Logo-Hoodie-Sweatshirt/dp/B09R2KNYZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1
34.,"I wanted a go-to front zip hoodie to wear with casual jeans. This GAP hoodie is soft, well made, and very comfortable. (Nothing itchy or irritating) The strange thing is that it took two months to get to me. (I somewhat knew this when I ordered it as it gave me a window for delivery) I recently learned that these GAP hoodies are making a comeback and are now pretty popular among teenagers. (I am much, much older than a teenager. ) I wasn’t in a hurry for it so no big deal. If I wanted another one, I would most like go to a GAP store to see if they had them in stock. Happy with my purchase and would recommend this product.FYI-I am 5’6” 107 lbs purchased a small and it is loose fitting.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Gap-womens-Logo-Hoodie-Sweatshirt/dp/B09R2KNYZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1

The blue is great, and it's comfortable cotton and easy to care for.  The fit is very nice, except the tummy area.  It's forgiving, but almost more like a regular quite loose dress would be forgiving.  I think it would work well until about the last trimester, when it would look like a regular but loose fitting dress being worn in place of a maternity dress.  And that's fine---maybe you want something for earlier in the pregnancy---but in the balance of looking not classically maternity style with fitting maternity style, it goes a little to the not looking maternity style side!","Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/GAP-Womens-Short-Sleeve-Uniform/dp/B0B6CX3RKT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1

17.,"This Gap skater dress is adorable, and we love that it's made of 100% cotton.  Our daughter is almost 16 months old, but she's wearing 24m and 2T clothing, and this dress fits well on her.  It's still a little long for her height, but the fit is otherwise good.The ""pull on"" closure mentioned in the product description just means that it's a pullover like a regular t-shirt.  There are no extra buttons to widen the collar.  The collar isn't very stretchy, so it's a little difficult to pull this dress over our daughter's 80th percentile head, but it does fit.I'd give this dress 5 stars if Gap just included some extra buttons to wide the collar when putting the dress on.  Otherwise, it's very comfy and looks very cute.","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/GAP-Girls-Skater-Dress-Floral/dp/B0B6D4B8T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1
17.,"This is the second time I have ordered a dress from GAP on amazon for my one year old. I tried 12-18 to small and now 18-24 still really to small. I am not sure if sizing is off , but the dress itself is super cute and good quality. For reference my one year old is 32 inches long and 22lbs.","Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/GAP-Girls-Skater-Dress-Floral/dp/B0B6D4B8T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1
17.,"This dress fit my daughter true to size and is so cute. It did not shrink once washed and is great quality!

17.,"Ordered this beautiful dress in 12-18 Months as a Baby Shower gift, and the mother was thrilled to receive it. It's a gorgeous floral pattern on a classic skater dress in 100% cotton.  Unlike some brands, GAP always delivers very high quality clothing that keeps classic styles looking fresh, and you can't go wrong with the brand. I'd highly recommend this dress as a gift for any baby girl out there - you will be a gift-giving hero!","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/GAP-Girls-Skater-Dress-Floral/dp/B0B6D4B8T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1
17.,"This is a very cute, very lightweight, what I would consider a ""t-shirt"" dress.  The outline is that of a skater dress but the dress itself feels very much like a t-shirt material.  Sizing on this one I bought is 12-18 months but with all GAP items, it's important to check the ht/wt recommendations.  I included the tag photo for size reference.  I find that GAP items run big on my children and they more closely fit the top end of the weight range.  For example, my 30lb toddler that is almost 3 can still wear size 12-18 months in GAP items.","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/GAP-Girls-Skater-Dress-Floral/dp/B0B6D4B8T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1

17.,"This dress is too cute - love the pattern and the fact that it's 100% cotton.  Like most GAP clothing, the sizing is a hit or miss.  This one is a little big on her, but I'm guessing that after a few washings it'll shrink up a bit.  She loves it and it is cool and comfortable for summer.","Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/GAP-Girls-Skater-Dress-Floral/dp/B0B6D4B8T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1

21.,"I've been a fan of Gap clothing for years, and their men's Vintage Logo Short Sleeve Tee T-Shirt is no exception. It's a classic, basic t-shirt that's made from high-quality materials and construction. The shirt is made from 100% cotton, and it has a soft, comfortable feel. The fit is true to size, and the shirt is long enough to cover your midriff without being too baggy. The logo is embroidered on the front of the shirt, and it's a subtle but stylish touch.I've worn this shirt on a variety of occasions, and it's always been a hit. It's perfect for everyday wear, and it can also be dressed up or down. I've worn it with jeans, shorts, and even a suit, and it always looks great.The price of this shirt is also very reasonable. For a quality t-shirt that's made to last, I think it's a great value. Overall, I'm very happy with this shirt, and I would definitely recommend it to others.Pros:Made from high-quality materialsSoft, comfortable feelTrue to sizeSubtle but stylish logoAffordable priceCons:None that I can think of!Overall:A great basic t-shirt that's perfect for everyday wear.
