505167032,"Best khakis on the market. Great quality cotton. True non iron treatment. Fit well, and comfortable move in. I usually wear these 2-3 times a week, and get about a year of wear before they start fading. Perfect for work, or around town."
500726002,"Excellent quality and comfort, a little baggier than I am used to but looks great"

505164012,Made with attention to details. Good purchase.
505161032,"My go to office pants. Fit well, wash well, wear well."
562185012,Amazing quality!
754657192,Sizing was all wrong and didn't fit!
539189002,"I got the coal black (it's dark gray) and just ordered the green and dark brown corduroy. I'm only 5' 4"" but I got the 4 tall (very tired of my pants all hitting above my ankle bone) and I like the length—they don't pool. I love the high rise and the waist fits me perfectly—I'm an hourglass and there is zero waist gap. Pants are surprisingly flattering and really comfortable. They look more like a straight than a barrel, but they look pulled together because of the slight taper at the bottom. These will be a new favorite."
811003002,Love the comfort of BR jeans. I have been buying the Slim Traveler Jean for years. Highest recommendation! Love that it has a little stretch to it and looks good after wearing all day.
787743002,great fit and don't stretch out during a full day of wear at work. Love the color and comfort of these pants.
882879022,It won't look good unless you have a small waist. The wrinkles are hard to come out. It's beautiful though
445873002,"I really like the pants, I just don't like the belt being so long."
744271212,I've been buying the ever evolving traveler pants in all colors since they launched. They come in all the best colors and textures and can be worn casually but also include fabric's that are a bit more dressy. I have found that they hold up beautifully in the wash and look great as they age with wear. Really the perfect year-round pants for every occasion.

513166032,Great fabric. Just way too baggy
733595012,"Fits well. Classic straight fit with a straight leg opening that I find larger than the openings in modern pants, but I was looking for something that didn't feel like it was squeezing and showing my ankles."
513193022,"Soft brushed cotton; Versatile color. Elastic waist band, A bonus."
754557002,Great fit! Super comfy. Dress up or down.
870410072,"Another great product from Banana Republic. He really like them, comfortable and no need to iron. Fit true to size."
809968042,"Awesome pants, fit well, good fabric, good stitching. Highly recommended. #sweepstakes"
418962062,Most comfortable; none belt wearing pants you will find. Plenty of room in thigh area and comfortable fabric
869396002,Very comfortable pants. Love it.
882886022,They are beautiful. I have then also in black and green.
869333002,"The most comfortable linen pants and great slim fit. I was looking for off white color, but ended up buying 3 extra shades. The material stretches little bit so I recommended buying them just a little tighter."
754652192,"These pants are the best. Both my husband and grown son love them. The fit is perfect, with the nice slim leg. Dress them up, or down and casual. Nicer than jeans, without losing the ""COOL"" look of jeans."
506869002,"I absolutely love these pants! The fit and quality are top notch! Make sure you bring these back, BR!!! I still need to buy a few more colors."
882908032,"These pants are gorgeous, they fit perfectly, look incredible and are comfortable. I bought them in my regular size and they fit well so are true to size."
420737032,"Fit, comfortable and no iron."
882899012,"Didn't look too special on a hanger but when ai tried it on, it looked like ones models have on that looks perfect. Very nice style and perfect length that hangs perfect when you have it on ."
744305112,"Love these pants, great fit, just enough stretch- fast delivery too"

884500002,I loved everything about these jeans. The color and fabric are awesome. The style was something different too. Unfortunately Being just over 5'1 they were only a dream. The petite size was not offered so back they went.
754552022,Fits at the waistline well and is so incredibly comfortable!
493050022,Nice fitting pants
513216002,No review found
815064012,The pant is as advertised and fits very well
882880012,Really love these pants. I actually ordered another pair. They fit perfectly!!
773624002,Ultimate style. The perfect little black pant. A wardrobe staple.
502839022,Love the fade and thickness of denim. The length wasn't as long as I anticipated so didn't need to cuff as high as I thought. Some other styles of denim for Fall 2024 had a ridiculously high cuff that look awful.
445941002,"Love the fabric and the cut but the sizing is off. I normally wear at 12 or L (L petite) I had to order multiple times, the 16 fits not sure its flattering."
445847012,I got lots of compliments due to the green color of this pants. Beautiful fit and color!
513169002,Amazing but had to snag both colors I previously order only the green. Amazing well made and cloth material cargo pants I had to reorder one size up and ended up getting both colts super comfortable and I imagine when l wear and the compliments this pants are fire.
882893032,"Very good quality material, lovely style; however I was shipped the wrong size so I wasn't able to try it on. Cara the banana republic agent was very helpful in reordering and sending me a return label. Now I have to wait and hope for the right size"
502843002,"I purchased size 35x34, measured the front rise at 12.75"" (sits pretty high which I like), leg opening 8.75"", thigh 14.0"" across leg right at crotch, and knee 10.75"", waistband 37.0"" (typical +2"" vanity sizing). BR's description of their Authentic Straight fit states it's more relaxed than their Straight fit, and this is def the case in the thighs and knees which are fairly baggy (the measurements reflect this). In my opinion, the fit is a clear departure from a 1950s/james dean kind of straight fit, nodding more toward baggy fits that are currently on trend. Although I found the legs to be baggier than my preference, the top block looked conventionally nice...didn't find the seat or hip area to be too big or saggy. The denim fabric is very good and there is a understated, simple elegance to the jeans with no logos or loud stitching. The rear leather patch is even plain with no logo or text, and the front metal button just says ""1978"" in very small text. I returned them bc the baggier fit isn't what I'm looking for, but it's a well-made product and I will try BRs regular Straight fit (non Authentic Straight) next time."
746693062,great pair of pants. will likely be great for winter as the material is a bit heavy.
574146012,Great fit and design. Perfect complement with chinos.
882900002,"The pants can be dressed up to wear to dinner with a blouse or worn to the farmers market with a cute tee and a pair of sandals or worn with a tank top and sneakers to a baseball game. The slacks are made from quality linen that is breathable and airy. The only thing to note is they are a little shorter on me then in the photo and I am 5'8"" but still a good length on me. I did order the long also just in case I did not like the length. I kept the regular length and exchanged the long for another pair of the regular length in a different color."
809141002,Great
420731022,"I'm pretty skinny (29x32 size) but the athletic fit still hugged my thighs and crotch area uncomfortably. I have a pair of athletic traveler pants in the exact same size which fit fine, so the inconsistent sizing is pretty disappointing."
746688002,"Love the fit and quality. Great for colder weather. 6 petite fits great for hight 5.2 and weight 120 pounds. Maybe not for flats, need to wear heels."
888317002,"I bought the Agustin Relaxed Linen-Blend Pant in Tanin brown for my fiancé, and they turned out to be the perfect choice! He tends to run hot, but the linen-blend material is so breathable and lightweight that he stays comfortable all day, even in warmer weather. The relaxed fit and high-quality fabric keep him cool without sacrificing style. Whether he's pairing them with a dress shirt for an evening out or a casual tee for a more laid-back look, these pants always look polished. The Tanin brown color is a great neutral that adds a sophisticated touch to his wardrobe. We couldn't be happier with this purchase!"
799303002,"I like the look and feel of these pants. This fits with most color dress shirts I have. The pants are a bit long and I had to get them hemmed at the shop. Other than that, they are great pants."

809139012,Good quality
320601002,"Great jeans from my favorite brand BR, quality, fit and comfort are so much better than AG, Frame, Joes or other premium brands. BR is my first choice in menswear."
869386002,The soft linen and straight cut of these pants give them a comfortable feel that works well at the office or just vibing.
882876022,"Wide for a straight pant, and a bit long. Otherwise great fit and material. I love the pockets of BR trousers."
445928012,All beautiful!!!
871151002,Bought it for my finance and he loves them.
890366002,Beautifully made good quality great navy blue color soft to the touch and a great value
454821012,Perfect comfy pants

891086002,"Love the quality and fit of these pants, I am 5.3"" tall size 4 and apparently petite is not available for this style, I just had them altered for the lenght since the fit ion the waist and the butt is very nice. I recommend this pants!"
445422022,very good
815006002,"Good summer weight. The 9"" length is a nice option. Not too long, but more leg coverage. Very comfortable. Glad they were on sale. Full price is a bit over priced for me."
884545002,I just purchased these and love the flare and fit. They can be dressed up or worn casual.
882894052,"Ordered smaller size as I thought it ran big. The waist was too stiff, tight and too high waisted but around hips it was very loose"
502849002,No review found
815370012,These are wonderful shorts. I enjoy the comfort of wearing shorts designed for adult men who want to stay cool and dress stylishly. The ladies have given me numerous comments on them.
492625002,"Runs small, I wear 2 but this is too small for me."
885671002,"I got these for my dad in his usual size 34x32. They are true to size. The linen and cotton blend is just perfect; cotton alone can look too much like workwear, and linen on its own is too casual. These pants are perfect warm weather backyard party/vacation/going out type of garment. The herringbone is subtle but elevates the pant instantly. Get them. #sweepstakes"

502774002,Feel and looks great on me
534241002,Super comfortable and soft. Paired the Jogger with the Herringbone Ponte Coach Jacket . Great look for travel and on the go! Has extra stretch for extra comfort.
454837002,"I love these, they fit great and are tight. The material is soft and comfortable. These are excellent for early fall."
445864012,Those front pleats could be limiting. I'm not too hippy and ordered my true BR size 10T. The pleats were poking out slightly in the thigh area even though not tight but loose in the waist causing a sag. I may size down and give it another shot. I got the Alix Satin pant too that fit me perfectly like it was custom made.

890127022,So cute.
871156002,"Love the drape, great pants."
502879002,Color was as advertised.
871161012,"Banana Republic has some of the best linen. But this Italian linen has taken the cake with quality and style. I liked them so much, I inadvertently bought the 3 pairs of pants (Al colors). You guys outdid your selves with these pants."
420657032,I wanted to get my husband up to date with his jeans. These looked great on him! I ordered a second pair with a lighter wash. BR has become my go to for us both. He now has several cashmere sweaters and it is always my go to especially if I need something for a special event!
539209002,"Purchased with the aim of wearing pants that fit as they do on the first model. Pants, lengthwise, are realistically comparable to where they fall on the second model. These are cropped pants. I'm 5'7"", 150lbs, and purchased my normal size 8. And they fit elsewhere as my other size 8s do. But cropped wool pants heading into winter just seems as though they won't get worn often. While there is a ""long"" option, it would affect the stride. I feel as though a longer stride wouldn't solve things because then it would just look goofy in that area. Also, not lined, for anyone curious. Which doesn't bother me but might bother others. Bummer."

755038002,"Has a great wash and fit. Decent amount of stretch but not too much. Doesn't hold its shape as you wear it. Gives off a very naturally worn classic cotton jean vibe, if you like that work it vibe."
809962052,"True to size, light, and breathable. Keeping me cool on these hot, humid summer days."
468742002,These were not straight leg they were extra wide leg. Not flattering on anyone under 6 feet.
753867002,"Great modern fit, the fabric is great, the fit is good."
468813002,No review found
871152002,Pants were more of a tapered fit than a slim straight fit. Pants seemed baggy in the seat and thigh and narrowed to a slim leg opening. Did not like the fit.

513213002,Beautiful pants with a perfect drape. Absolutely gorgeous.
573143002,Very good
502838002,I like the quality of the fabric.
871167002,Fabric is divine
869181052,Comfortable and user friendly linen shorts. Perfect for every occasion.
881530002,"This suit pant is amazing, color is beautiful, not to mention the quality behind it. I also bought it for an amazing discount that may still be going on. You will not regret this purchase!"
