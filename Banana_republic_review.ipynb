I'm only 5' 4\" but I got the 4 tall (very tired of my pants all hitting above my ankle bone) and I like the length—they don't pool. I love the high rise and the waist fits me perfectly—I'm an hourglass and there is zero waist gap. Pants are surprisingly flattering and really comfortable. They look more like a straight than a barrel, but they look pulled together because of the slight taper at the bottom. These will be a new favorite.\n",

      "Review: I purchased size 35x34, measured the front rise at 12.75\" (sits pretty high which I like), leg opening 8.75\", thigh 14.0\" across leg right at crotch, and knee 10.75\", waistband 37.0\" (typical +2\" vanity sizing). BR's description of their Authentic Straight fit states it's more relaxed than their Straight fit, and this is def the case in the thighs and knees which are fairly baggy (the measurements reflect this). In my opinion, the fit is a clear departure from a 1950s/james dean kind of straight fit, nodding more toward baggy fits that are currently on trend. Although I found the legs to be baggier than my preference, the top block looked conventionally nice...didn't find the seat or hip area to be too big or saggy. The denim fabric is very good and there is a understated, simple elegance to the jeans with no logos or loud stitching. The rear leather patch is even plain with no logo or text, and the front metal button just says \"1978\" in very small text. I returned them bc the baggier fit isn't what I'm looking for, but it's a well-made product and I will try BRs regular Straight fit (non Authentic Straight) next time.\n",

The relaxed fit and high-quality fabric keep him cool without sacrificing style. Whether he's pairing them with a dress shirt for an evening out or a casual tee for a more laid-back look, these pants always look polished.

These are cropped pants. I'm 5'7\", 150lbs, and purchased my normal size 8. And they fit elsewhere as my other size 8s do. But cropped wool pants heading into winter just seems as though they won't get worn often. While there is a \"long\" option, it would affect the stride. I feel as though a longer stride wouldn't solve things because then it would just look goofy in that area. Also, not lined, for anyone curious. Which doesn't bother me but might bother others.
