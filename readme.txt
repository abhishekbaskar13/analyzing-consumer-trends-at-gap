1. About The Project
	
This project aims to understand the case study that analyzes Gap Inc.'s adoption of a data-driven strategy, "Product 3.0," aimed at reversing declining sales and market share under CEO Art Peck's leadership. Gap faced challenges from fast fashion competitors and the rise of e-commerce. By removing Creative Directors and focusing solely on data-driven processes, the strategy aimed to boost short-term sales and market share, which succeeded temporarily. However, it failed to address long-term brand image issues, particularly for Gap and Banana Republic, which did not benefit from the fast-fashion trends that helped Old Navy. The analysis concludes that Gap should balance data-driven decisions with creative intuition to build distinct brand identities while leveraging web data to stay competitive. Strategic suggestions include integrating data with human creativity to better cater to the unique nature of each brand and utilizing web data for proactive course correction.
